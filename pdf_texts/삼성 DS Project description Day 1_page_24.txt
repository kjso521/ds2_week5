• In practical scenarios, clean ground-truth images are rarely available
→A purely supervised approach is unrealistic in many applications
• Possible approaches to consider:
- Denoising: self-supervised learning, filtering, …
- Deconvolution: leveraging multi-orientation information, regularization, thresholding, …
- General approach: generating pseudo labels, and any other creative ways
