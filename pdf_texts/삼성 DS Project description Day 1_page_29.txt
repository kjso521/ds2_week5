• Use the forward model to synthesize training pairs
• Construct a pipeline to restore corrupted images into clean images 
• You are free to explore any architectures or algorithms
- Classical image processing
- End-to-end approach (corrupted → clean)
- Two-stage approach (denoising + deconvolution)
- Self-supervised or label-free strategies (recommended for realism)
- Etc.
• Requirements:
- For each clean image, you may generate up to 6 dipole kernel orientations.
- For each orientation, you may generate up to 2 noisy images.
- Do not exceed 12 corrupted images per clean image (6 orientations ×2 noises)
