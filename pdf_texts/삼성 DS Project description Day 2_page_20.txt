How do you implement?
Y = AX
Y: Input in Fourier domain ← we measured it
A: Kernel in Fourier domain ← we know shape but has lots of zeros
X: Output in Fourier domain ← what we want to know
X = A−1Y Nope! Ais not full rank 
min
X
ԡY ԡ−AX +  regularization term  
n2 x 1 vector
n2 x 1 vector for n×nsize image
n2 x n2 matrix
