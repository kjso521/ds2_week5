How do you implement? How do you make skinny matrix?
Y = AX
Y: Input in Fourier domain ← we measured it
A: Kernel in Fourier domain ← we know shape but has lots of zeros
X: Output in Fourier domain ← what we want to know
n2 x 1 vector
n2 x 1 vector for n×nsize image
n2 x n2 matrix
Fy = AFχ y: Input
y = F−1AFχ
minχ ԡy ԡ−F−1AFχ +  regularization term
n2 x 1 vector
Perform 2D FT, kernel multiplication, 2D FT-1 then columnize matrix
